        <article class="history">
            <p>TechCon was founded in the late 1980s, during a period of rapid technological growth. The idea stemmed from the need for a dedicated space where professionals, developers, and tech enthusiasts could exchange ideas about the burgeoning fields of computing and electronics. At that time, conferences focusing solely on technology were rare, and many technological innovations were presented at broader scientific and industrial fairs.

                The first TechCon was held in San Francisco in 1989, attended by a modest crowd of about 500 people. The theme was primarily centered around the emerging personal computer revolution, with sessions on the latest in computer hardware, software development, and the newly forming internet. What made TechCon unique from the start was its open-floor concept, where even small startup firms could present their ideas alongside industry giants.</p>
